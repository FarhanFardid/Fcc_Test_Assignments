<div class="p1" id="p1">Chicken</div>
<p class="content">Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising 
    chickens—in comparison to mammals 
    such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat (commonly called just "chicken") and chicken eggs have
     become prevalent in numerous cuisines. Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, 
     and boiling. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes
      cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.</p>

        <p class="p2" id="p2">Beef</p>
        <p class="content">Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus).
            In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and later domesticated
             them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred 
             specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, 
             beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after
              pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and 
              China were the largest producers of beef.</p>

        <p class="p3" id="p3"> Sushi</p>
        <p class="content">Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some 
            sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients, 
            such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its 
            presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", 
            also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.

            The inventor of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented
             nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most known today, in which seafood is 
             placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period 
             (1603-1867). It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo 
             period.
